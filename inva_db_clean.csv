Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) transmit several important veterinary diseases, including bluetongue virus (BTV). The economic damage caused by BTV is difficult to estimate as many of the costs are indirect, for example, as a result of trade restrictions. However, one recent study suggests that the cost of the recent emergence in northern Europe in 2006 and 2007 was around €200 000 000 to the Netherlands alone.
The net costs (costs minus benefits) of the BTV8 epidemic of 2006 (BT2006) was estimated at 32.4 million Euros. The net costs of the BTV8 epidemic of 2007 (BT2007) was valued at 164–175million Euros (median = 169,5 million), depending on the mortality and morbidity rates for cattle used.

Hoffmann, Philip Ivey, David C. Le Maitre, Joslin L. Moore, David M. Richardson, Mathieu Rouget, Andrew Wannenburgh and John R. U. Wilson","Aim: A range of approaches and philosophies underpin national-level strategies for managing invasive alien plants. This study presents a strategy for the management of taxa that both have value and do harm.
Location: South Africa. Methods: Insights were derived from examining Australian Acacia species in South Africa (c. 70 species introduced, mostly > 150 years ago; some have commercial and other values; 14 species are invasive, causing substantial ecological and economic damage). We consider options for combining available tactics and management practices. We defined (1) categories of species based on invaded area (a surrogate for impact) and the value of benefits generated and (2) management regions based on habitat suitability and degree of invasion. For each category and region, we identified strategic goals and proposed the combinations of management practices to move the system in the desired direction. Results: We identified six strategic goals that in combination would apply to eight species categories. We further identified 14 management practices that could be strategically combined to achieve these goals for each category in five discrete regions. When used in appropriate combinations, the prospect of achieving the strategic goal will be maximized. As the outcomes of management cannot be accurately predicted, management must be adaptive, requiring continuous monitoring and assessment, and realignment of goals if necessary. Main conclusions: Invasive Australian Acacia species in South Africa continue to spread and cause undesirable impacts, despite a considerable investment into management.

Marnotte","In forest areas of Côte d'Ivoire, rainfed rice is widely grown following slash-and-burn, and is sometimes intercropped with maize. However, smallholders are often forced to abandon their fields, even before soil fertility problems arise, because of the invasion weed Chromolaena odorata. From 1989 to 1991, IDESSA (Institut des savanes) conducted a herbicide control research programme using 2,4-D in smallholders' fields. The number, dosages, treatment dates and toxicity on maize were monitored. The results indicated that two 2,4-D treatments should be recommended at 770-1440 g a.i./ha/treatment, depending on weed densities: the first at the C. odorata 3-4 leaf stage, the second 8 days later. There was no toxicity noted on maize plants. Nozzles on conventional spraying equipment were adapted for low-volume spraying to minimize water transport and working time. This technique is faster, cheamer and as efficient as manual weeding.

The objective of this study was to evaluate costs of vector control, direct medical costs and indirect costs associated with classical dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, chikungunya and Zika virus infection in Brazil for the year 2016. Methods: The analyzes quantified costs related to vector control, such as federal resource transfers and acquisition of pesticides, direct medical costs related to diseases treatment through outpatient and hospital management, and indirect costs re­lated to absenteeism, calculated from published studies or estimates of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Results: The investment for vector combat was R$ 1.5 billion in Brazil and the cost reported by federal government for the acquisition of insecticides and larvicides was R$ 78.6 million. Direct medical costs generated total expenses of R$ 374 million.

invasion research is to develop the ability to predict the spread of species.
2. Throughout the world, Ludwigia peploides subsp. montevidensis and Ludwigia grandiflora subsp. hexapetala
are now considered to be two of the most invasive aquatic plants. This paper reviews the scientific knowledge
about these species, their ecological and socio-economic impacts and methods of management.
3. Water primrose possesses some advantageous biological traits, such as rapid growth rate, efficient
reproductive capacity, high plasticity in growth response, broad ecological tolerance and allelopathic
compounds which might explain its expansion and colonization of numerous ecosystems.
4. Much attention must be paid to Ludwigia grandiflora subsp. hexapetala and Ludwigia peploides subsp.

"IC_2.1_5402","SC209",NA,"Leavold2007","Development of case studies on the economic impacts of invasive species in Africa: Salvinia molesta","Leavold, V. Lloyd, L. and Lepetit, J.","This report details the results of an extensive desktop study to quantify the economic impacts of an invasive weed species in Africa. Salvinia molesta (Salvinia) is a floating water weed found in the lower Senegal River delta in Senegal. Salvinia reproduces vegetatively, is easily spread by flowing water as well as by stock, vehicles and water craft. The plant forms a thick mat on the water’s surface, making transport by water difficult, interfering with fishing activities as well as limiting biodiversity by blocking sunlight and impeding oxygen exchange. Salvinia infestation of the Djoudj National Park and other areas may lead to a reduction in tourist numbers. This report examines the economic impact of this invasive weed species, including impacts on fishing yields, agricultural production and tourism. The impacts were valued using market prices (where available) and published data on yields and productivity. A risk assessment was carried out for the species, on the basis of both natural and structural (political) risks. This identified a number of countries at significant risk of invasion by the species considered, including invasion of Salvinia into Mali and Nigeria. Further spread within the Senegal was also noted to be a significant risk. A number of potential management methods are investigated, including chemical, mechanical and biological control. Cost-benefit analyses of management methods are presented. The effectiveness of management measures is expected to increase if a variety of methods are used in conjunction as part of an integrated weed management plan. Management costs per hectare varied from approximately US$11 to US$4000. Low management costs may be partly due to the assumption that labour has a very low opportunity cost in regions where unemployment is high. However, this disguises the fact that labour availability for other domestic chores is reduced when labour is required for weed management activities. Prevention measures to avoid weed infestation are examined, including legislative measures,
quarantine controls, education and community participation, monitoring and early detection and contingency planning. Although little evidence of the cost and effectiveness of these measures was available in the literature, it was generally acknowledged that prevention of invasion was more cost effective than management of established weed populations. Annual prevention costs of less than US$2 per hectare are estimated for capital-intensive methods of monitoring and early detection to avoid establishment of weed infestations.",2007,"English","Peer-reviewed article","Pieterse et al. 2003","Yes","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Polypodiopsida","Salviniales","Salviniaceae","Salvinia","Salvinia molesta",NA,"Kariba weed","Aquatic","Aquatic",NA,NA,"other","N","N","Africa","Senegal",NA,"Senegal","Country","2000","Period",2000,2000,2000,2000,"One-time","1000.00",NA,NA,"1423.46","4529.38",1000,1423.46,4529.38,"USD",2000,"Effective","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Control","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","Cost of manual labour","Desika Moodley","No"

Vila M & Hulme PE.","Despite biological invasions being a worldwide phenomenon causing significant ecological, economic, and human welfare impacts, there is limited understanding regarding how environmental managers perceive the problem and subsequently manage alien species. Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires to (1) analyze the extent to which they perceive plant invasions as a problem; (2) identify the status, occurrence, and impacts of noxious alien plant species; (3) assess current effort and expenditure targeting alien plant management; and, finally, (4) identify the criteria they use to set priorities for management. In comparison to other environmental concerns, plant invasions are perceived as only moderately problematic and mechanical control is the most valued and frequently used strategy to cope with plant invasions in Spain. Based on 70 questionnaires received, 193 species are considered noxious, 109 of which have been the subject of management activities. More than 90% of species are found in at least one protected area. According to respondents, the most frequently managed species are the most widespread across administrative regions and the ones perceived as causing the highest impacts. The perception of impact seems to be independent of their invasion status, since only half of the species identified as noxious are believed to be invasive in Spain, while 43% of species thought to only be casual aliens are causing a high impact. Records of management costs are poor and the few data indicate that the total actual expenditure amounted to 50,492,437 € in the last decade.

Hence, INNS are the subject of considerable concern in Great Britain, prompting the development of a Non-Native Species Strategy and the formation of the GB Non-Native Species Programme Board and Secretariat. A number of estimates of the economic impact of INNS on various countries, including the UK, exist, but the detail in many of these estimates is lacking and the impact on different sectors of the country is largely unknown.

The report provides assessments of the economic cost of INNS to twelve sectors and the report contains detailed examples for three species (Japanese knotweed, signal crayfish and floating pennywort). Five case studies are also included to demonstrate the costs of eradication at different stages of invasion. The report only considers negative economic impacts of INNS, although it is acknowledged that non-native species, including some invasive ones can make a positive contribution to the economy.

Africa. Thick mats of A. filiculoides on dams and slow-moving water bodies cause economic losses to water-users. Affected waterusers
were surveyed using a questionnaire to assess the importance of the weed. Among those most seriously affected were farming
(71%), recreational (24%), and municipal (5%) users. The average water area covered by A. filiculoides (per water-user) was 2.17 ha,
with an expansion rate of 1.33 ha per year. The frond-feeding weevil Stenopelmus rufinasus was released as a biological control agent
at the end of 1997. Within 3 years, the weevil had reduced the weed population to the point that it was no longer considered a
problem in South Africa. Based on year 2000 data, the cost savings (per user per hectare) resulting from the biological control
program included a reduction of on-site damages caused bythe weed to the value of US$589 per hectare per year. The average cost
per hectare per year for the biological control program for the period 1995–2000 amounted to US$278, excluding investment costs of
USD$7700 in 1995. These historic costs and benefits were adjusted to constant year 2000 values. The predicted spread of the weed
was calculated on the basis of a sigmoid-curve rate of spread model. The net present value (NPV) of the program was calculated
from 1995 onwards and discounted at 8%. This resulted in a NPV of US$1093 per hectare and US$206 million for South Africa as a
whole. For the year 2000, the benefit–cost ratio was calculated at 2.5:1, increasing rapidly to 13:1 in 2005, and 15:1 in 2010 as the
costs of the biological control program are expected to decrease. These indicators reinforce the overall economic viabilityof biological
control, but do not necessarilyconfirm the viabilityof biological control on each management unit itself. The results reflect
the dynamics of biological control on site-specific survey information, and place higher benefit–cost ratios achieved in other national
level studies in a better context. It also raises the important policyquestion of who is responsible to finance such control programs in
future, because on-site benefits of control are enough to justifythe program in its own right. The paper concludes with recommendations
on a financial mechanism to address biological control of invasive species in a sustainable manner.",2003,"English","Peer-reviewed article",NA,"Yes","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Polypodiopsida","Salviniales","Salviniaceae","Azolla","Azolla filiculoides",NA,"Red water fern","Aquatic","Aquatic",NA,"11","other","N","N","Africa","South Africa",NA,"South Africa","Country","1995-2000","Period",1995,2000,1995,2000,"One-time","54662.00",NA,NA,"77809.10","198068.52",9110.33,12968.18,33011.42,"USD",2000,"Effective","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Control","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"yes","The total cost of developing and releasing Stenopelmus rufinasus, plus start-up costs.

Vila M & Hulme PE.","Despite biological invasions being a worldwide phenomenon causing significant ecological, economic, and human welfare impacts, there is limited understanding regarding how environmental managers perceive the problem and subsequently manage alien species. Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires to (1) analyze the extent to which they perceive plant invasions as a problem; (2) identify the status, occurrence, and impacts of noxious alien plant species; (3) assess current effort and expenditure targeting alien plant management; and, finally, (4) identify the criteria they use to set priorities for management. In comparison to other environmental concerns, plant invasions are perceived as only moderately problematic and mechanical control is the most valued and frequently used strategy to cope with plant invasions in Spain. Based on 70 questionnaires received, 193 species are considered noxious, 109 of which have been the subject of management activities. More than 90% of species are found in at least one protected area. According to respondents, the most frequently managed species are the most widespread across administrative regions and the ones perceived as causing the highest impacts. The perception of impact seems to be independent of their invasion status, since only half of the species identified as noxious are believed to be invasive in Spain, while 43% of species thought to only be casual aliens are causing a high impact. Records of management costs are poor and the few data indicate that the total actual expenditure amounted to 50,492,437 € in the last decade. The majority of respondents stated that management measures are insufficient to control alien plants due to limited economic resources, lack of public awareness and support, and an absence of coordination among different public administrations. Managers also expressed their concern about the fact that much scientific research is concerned with the ecology of alien plants rather than with specific cost-efficient strategies to manage alien species.",2009,"English","Peer-reviewed article",NA,"Yes","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Magnoliopsida","Fabales","Fabaceae","Acacia","Acacia sp.",NA,"Wattles","Terrestrial","Terrestrial",NA,NA,"other","N","N","Europe","Spain","Spain","Spain","Country","most probably the last decade","Period",1999,2009,1999,2009,"Potentially ongoing","90000.00",NA,NA,"143424.97","143110.53",8181.82,13038.63,13010.05,"EUR",2009,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Control","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires.

INNS are increasingly abundant in Great Britain and in Europe generally and their impact is rising. Hence, INNS are the subject of considerable concern in Great Britain, prompting the development of a Non-Native Species Strategy and the formation of the GB Non-Native Species Programme Board and Secretariat. A number of estimates of the economic impact of INNS on various countries, including the UK, exist, but the detail in many of these estimates is lacking and the impact on different sectors of the country is largely unknown. This research estimates the current annual cost of INNS to the British economy. The report provides assessments of the economic cost of INNS to twelve sectors and the report contains detailed examples for three species (Japanese knotweed, signal crayfish and floating pennywort). Five case studies are also included to demonstrate the costs of eradication at different stages of invasion. The report only considers negative economic impacts of INNS, although it is acknowledged that non-native species, including some invasive ones can make a positive contribution to the economy. Various methods were used to secure data for economic estimations. References of relevance to over 500 non-native species were gathered from the scientific and grey literature as well as the internet. A detailed questionnaire was sent to key organisations, primarily to develop contacts but also to gather initial information. The collected information was used to estimate the costs, partially based on calculations for individual species, which was anonymously reviewed by selected experts from each of the sectors.

The report provides assessments of the economic cost of INNS to twelve sectors and the report contains detailed examples for three species (Japanese knotweed, signal crayfish and floating pennywort). Five case studies are also included to demonstrate the costs of eradication at different stages of invasion. The report only considers negative economic impacts of INNS, although it is acknowledged that non-native species, including some invasive ones can make a positive contribution to the economy. Various methods were used to secure data for economic estimations. References of relevance to over 500 non-native species were gathered from the scientific and grey literature as well as the internet. A detailed questionnaire was sent to key organisations, primarily to develop contacts but also to gather initial information. The collected information was used to estimate the costs, partially based on calculations for individual species, which was anonymously reviewed by selected experts from each of the sectors. The total current annual cost of INNS to the British economy is estimated, when corrected for double counting, at £1,291,461,000 to England, £244,736,000 to Scotland and £125,118,000 to Wales.

focuses on a set of invasive alien aquatic plant species
(notably the 21 listed by the European and Mediterranean
Plant ProtectionOrganisation, i.e., five A2 species,
11 invasive, 2 in the Observation List, 1 in the Alert List,
2 noteworthy), on definitions in use, on introduction
pathways, and ecological effects, although the social
and economic effects of freshwater invaders can be
diverse and substantial. Legislation, literature, and
scientific research dealing with plant invasions in inland
waters often merge different types of invasive plant
species and invaded habitats, as there are some
overlappings between the concepts of macrophyte,
aquatic plants, inland waters, wetlands, and riparian
habitats. Freshwater ecosystems may well be the most
endangered ecosystems in the world. Countless aquatic
plants have been introduced in Europe and in the
Mediterranean region, either deliberately because they
were thought to be ornamental or otherwise desirable, or
accidentally as releases from aquaria, dumping from
water gardens, or contaminants. The escape of alien
plants from managed environments is also frequent.
Aquatic invaders have strong negative impacts on native
biodiversity and many different impacts are reported in
the literature for Europe and worldwide. Plant invasions
in inlandwatersmay be considered as one of a syndrome
of factors that characterize degraded aquatic ecosystems.
There are a number of risk analysis, impact
assessment, ranking systems, decision trees, and prioritization
methods available throughout Europe and the
EPPO region, but the lack of a common framework for
assessing the risks posed by invasive alien aquatic
species is seen as a key gap. Successful management
should include prevention, habitat restoration, dedicated
risk assessment, prioritization, awareness raising, dedicated
legislation, collaboration between different
stakeholders, development of codes of conduct with
the horticultural sector, and prohibiting the sale,
purchase, and intentional release of some species in
the wild. Actions to protect the European and Mediterranean
inland waters from plants invasions are urgently
needed and could provide overarching benefits.",2015,"English","Peer-reviewed article",NA,"Yes","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Magnoliopsida","Apiales","Apiaceae","Hydrocotyle","Hydrocotyle ranunculoides",NA,"Floating pennywort","Aquatic","Semi-aquatic",NA,"11","other","N","Y","Europe","United Kingdom",NA,"United Kingdom","Country","2002","Year",2002,2002,2002,2002,"Potentially ongoing","275000.00","250000.00","300000.00","561653.76","543210.59",275000,561653.76,543210.59,"GBP",2002,"Effective","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Control","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"yes","In the UK, the estimate for control of the total area infested by H.

INTRODUCTION	
Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms-Lamb (Family Pontederiaceae) is a floating aquatic plant with inflated petioles and native to tropical America (Hutchinson and Dalziel 1968). It is believed that the weed originated in Brazil, but is widely spread all over the Southern and Central American countries having been introduced as an ornamental in the 1890’s (Penfound and Earle 1948). As of 1961, water hyacinth was outside all territories in West Africa South of latitude 18°N and to the west of Lake Chad, and Fernando Po Island (Hutchinson and Dalziel 1968). It is a major weed in several regions of the world having climatic regions similar to its native habitat. In recent years it has been reported to occur in the tropical regions of Asia, Australia, and Africa where it is reported to be particularly noxious in the Congo River of the Zaire Republic and the White Nile system of the Sudan (Irving and Beshir 1982).
In many countries where it is a pernicious weed, it has been found to interfere with river transportation, irrigation channels, pumps and access to water for riverine settlements and recreational activities. It has been found to drastically increase evapotranspirational losses as well as fish losses (Irving and Beshir, 1982). In Sudan for example, the aquatic weed infested the Nile main stream and adjoining rivers in excess of 3,000 km thereby producing serious problems for the use of the river as a resource (Irving and Beshir, 1982).
Eichhornia natans (P. Beanv.) Solms-Lamb is a less proficient weed and a close relative of E. crassipes that was reported in 1961 to be common in Nigeria and several African states like Uganda, Zaire and Zambia (Hutchinson and Dalziel 1968). However, on January 12, 1985, the alarm of the invasion of Nigerian coastal creeks and lagoons by water hyacinth was raised by one of the national dailies. Shortly after this initial announcement, investigations were conducted and the weed was properly identified as a water hyacinth (E. crassipes) (Prof. K. Kusemiju, University of Lagos, Personal Communication).
This paper examines the status of the aquatic weed in the Nigerian lagoons and creeks, potential methods of control, utilization options, and the current efforts of the Nigerian government on its control.
STATUS OF WATER HYACINTH IN NIGERIAN WATERS
Water hyacinth has become a major weed in Nigeria having successfully invaded and established itself on the entire Badagary creek, the Yewa lagoon, Ologe lagoon, the Lagos lagoon and the waterways of the riverine areas of Okitipupa (Fig. 1). It was reported in 1982 in the local newspapers as a weed that is spreading fast and paralysing the fishing industry. Since this initial report, the surge in growth has become phenomenal leading to complete coverage of some of the creeks and lagoons mentioned above. As a result of the current invasion, more than one third of Nigeria’s local fish supply is now threatened by

seaweeds. The predominant impacts were
changed competitive relationships in the recipient habitat,
indicated by high abundances of invaders, resultant
space monopolization, and reduced abundances/biomass
of native macrophytes. Changes in biodiversity,
effects on fish and invertebrate fauna, toxic effects on
other biota, and habitat change were also identified. The
mechanisms underlying the manifestation of impacts are
uncertain and inferences about common patterns were
hampered because impact studies were available for only
a few introduced seaweeds, covered only a fraction of
their introduced distribution and generally were conducted
over short time scales. There was no information
about evolutionary effects or changes of ecosystem
processes. Knowledge of socio-economic impacts of
invasive seaweeds is poor. We collated costs associated
with control/eradication activities and for national spending
on marine biosecurity in Australia, New Zealand and
the United States. Prevention of impacts is the driving
force for costly surveillance, eradication and control programs.
Until we are able to understand, predict and
measure impacts of introduced seaweeds, the management
of species incursions needs to remain focused on
early detection, rapid response and control to reduce the

Vila M & Hulme PE.","Despite biological invasions being a worldwide phenomenon causing significant ecological, economic, and human welfare impacts, there is limited understanding regarding how environmental managers perceive the problem and subsequently manage alien species. Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires to (1) analyze the extent to which they perceive plant invasions as a problem; (2) identify the status, occurrence, and impacts of noxious alien plant species; (3) assess current effort and expenditure targeting alien plant management; and, finally, (4) identify the criteria they use to set priorities for management. In comparison to other environmental concerns, plant invasions are perceived as only moderately problematic and mechanical control is the most valued and frequently used strategy to cope with plant invasions in Spain. Based on 70 questionnaires received, 193 species are considered noxious, 109 of which have been the subject of management activities. More than 90% of species are found in at least one protected area. According to respondents, the most frequently managed species are the most widespread across administrative regions and the ones perceived as causing the highest impacts. The perception of impact seems to be independent of their invasion status, since only half of the species identified as noxious are believed to be invasive in Spain, while 43% of species thought to only be casual aliens are causing a high impact. Records of management costs are poor and the few data indicate that the total actual expenditure amounted to 50,492,437 € in the last decade. The majority of respondents stated that management measures are insufficient to control alien plants due to limited economic resources, lack of public awareness and support, and an absence of coordination among different public administrations. Managers also expressed their concern about the fact that much scientific research is concerned with the ecology of alien plants rather than with specific cost-efficient strategies to manage alien species.",2009,"English","Peer-reviewed article",NA,"Yes","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Polypodiopsida","Salviniales","Salviniaceae","Azolla","Azolla filiculoides",NA,"Water fern","Aquatic","Aquatic",NA,NA,"other","N","N","Europe","Spain","Spain","Spain","Country","most probably the last decade","Period",1999,2009,1999,2009,"Potentially ongoing","1000000.00",NA,NA,"1593610.83","1590117.03",90909.09,144873.71,144556.09,"EUR",2009,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Control","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires.

"IC_2.1_6241","SC1093",NA,"Ciruna2004","The ecological and socio-economic impacts of invasive alien species on inland water ecosystems","Ciruna, K. A., Meyerson, L. A., & Gutierrez, A.","Invasive  alien  species  (IAS)  and  their  effects  on  the  environment,  economy,  and  human  health  have   captured   the   attention   of   scientists,   natural   resource   managers,   and   policy   makers   worldwide.  Article  8(h)  of  the  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  (CBD)  calls  on  member  governments  to  “as  far  as  is  appropriate:  Prevent  the  introduction  of,  control  or  eradicate  those  alien species which threaten ecosystems, habitats, or species,” and calls for particular attention to be directed to geographically and evolutionarily isolated ecosystems, including islands. On behalf of  the  CBD  and  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  the  GlobalInvasive Species Programme (GISP) convened a workshop in October 2002 to review the socio-economic and biological impacts of IAS on island systems.  Experts from 10 countries, as well as GISP,  the  World  Conservation  Union  (IUCN),  and  the  World  Conservation  Monitoring  Centre  (WCMC) participated.   Participants in the Experts Consultation reached the following major conclusions: For biological and  socio-economic  reasons,  islands  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  bioinvasions.    IAS  can  influence island environments at all levels of biological organization and also impact agriculture, fisheries,  tourism,  energy,  water,  and  human  health.    Lack  of  access  to  extant  technologies,  particularly in small island developing States (SIDS) has resulted in IAS impacts that might have otherwise been avoided.  While foreign aid can support IAS prevention and control efforts, it canalso facilitate IAS introductions.  Political pressure may exist to introduce IAS that will provide short-term  economic  benefits  regardless  of  the  longer-term  biological  costs.  Although  ballast  water  is  a  well-recognized  pathway  for  marine  bioinvasions,  ship  hull  fouling  by  marineorganisms is an often overlooked but significant pathway.   The  following  actions  were  recommended  by  the  workshop  participants:  Develop  informaticscapacities  to  increase  knowledge  of  and  access  to  successful  and  cost-effective  IAS  prevention  and  management  tools.    Establish  comprehensive  IAS  surveillance  programs  to  enable  earlydetection  and  rapid  response.    Undertake  further  assessments  of  IAS  pathways  and  impacts,  making  the  results  widely  available  to  resource  managers  and  policy  makers.    Implement  legal  frameworks  to  minimize  the  risk  of  bioinvasion  and  develop  alternatives  to  toxic  anti-fouling  agents.

M., Aquiloni, L., Banha, F., Choquer, J., Chucholl, C., & Tricarico, E.","Procambarus clarkii is currently recorded from 16 European territories. On top of being a vector of crayfish plague, which is responsible for large-scale disappearance of native crayfish species, it causes severe impacts on diverse aquatic ecosystems, due to its rapid life cycle, dispersal capacities, burrowing activities and high population densities. The species has even been recently discovered in caves. This invasive crayfish is a polytrophic keystone species that can exert multiple pressures on ecosystems. Most studies deal with the decline of macrophytes and predation on several species (amphibians, molluscs, and macroinvertebrates), highlighting how this biodiversity loss leads to unbalanced food chains. At a management level, the species is considered as (a) a devastating digger of the water drainage systems in southern and central Europe, (b) an agricultural pest in Mediterranean territories, consuming, for example, young rice plants, and (c) a threat to the restoration of water bodies in north-western Europe. Indeed, among the high-risk species, P. clarkii consistently attained the highest risk rating. Its negative impacts on ecosystem services were evaluated. These may include the loss of provisioning services such as reductions in valued edible native species of regulatory and supporting services, inducing wide changes in ecological communities and increased costs to agriculture and water management. Finally, cultural services may be lost. The species fulfils the criteria of the Article 4(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament (species widely spread in Europe and impossible to eradicate in a cost-effective manner) and has been included in the “Union List”. Particularly, awareness of the ornamental trade through the internet must be reinforced within the European Community and import and trade regulations should be imposed to reduce the availability of this high-risk species.

The existing policy objective of eradication is shown to be inappropriate for economic and practical reasons. Cost-benefit analysis indicates that current government control programmes yield positive net benefits at a 10% discount rate, under realistic population growth-rate assumptions.

The introduction of invasive alien species is considered to be one of the most serious threats to global biodiversity. Alien species can also have substantial economic and social impacts.
People have moved plant and animal species to new areas throughout history: often, this has been for our own benefit, to use them as agricultural crops or livestock. In many cases, the consequences of such introductions have been mainly positive or neutral.
More recently, there has been a considerable rise in introductions of alien species, particularly as a result of changes in international patterns of transport and trade. This has resulted in growing awareness of the negative impacts certain species can have when they are introduced outside their natural distribution ranges.
In Norway, too, the introduction and spread of invasive alien species is a serious and growing threat to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and has already inflicted heavy costs on society.
Dealing with alien species involves a complex set of challenges. Most introduced species are not able to survive and spread in the wild. Others become established without harming the ecosystems where they are introduced. But some species both become established and cause significant damage to ecosystems, for example by displacing native species or spreading disease. These are known as invasive alien species, and they can have very serious negative impacts, both on ecosystems and biodiversity and on industries such as agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture that are based on the use of these ecosystems.
Measures to address the problem of invasive alien species in Norway will also be important in efforts to achieve the target of halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. Under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Norway has undertaken as far as possible and as appropriate to prevent the introduction of, control or eradicate those alien species which threaten ecosystems, habitats or species.
Many different bodies in a range of administrative sectors are responsible for action to address the problem of alien species and for administration and enforcement of legislation relating to the introduction, spread, and management and control of alien species. Effective action to reduce the threat from alien species therefore requires targeted and coordinated cross-sectoral efforts. The decision to draw up a cross-sectoral national strategy on alien species was taken in the 2005 white paper on the government’s environmental policy and the state of the environment in Norway (Report No. 21 (2004–2005) to the Storting) and the subsequent debate in the Storting.
This document describes Norway’s goals and principles for dealing with alien species and specific measures that will be implemented in all relevant administrative sectors. The strategy is intended to ensure that there is a common understanding and",2007,"English","Official report",NA,"Yes","Animalia","Chordata","Actinopterygii","Cypriniformes","Cyprinidae","Phoxinus","Phoxinus phoxinus",NA,"common minnow","Aquatic","Aquatic",NA,"11","other",NA,"N","Europe","Norway",NA,"Diverse/Unspecified","Country","2005","Year",2005,NA,2005,2005,"Potentially ongoing","2000000.00",NA,NA,"403365.48","264723.22",2e+06,403365.48,264723.22,"NOK",2007,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Communication/Control/Eradication/Research","Management","Mixed","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","pp11: ""In 2005, NOK 2 million was allocated to measures to prevent the spread of minnows and certain other freshwater organisms.

Vila M & Hulme PE.","Despite biological invasions being a worldwide phenomenon causing significant ecological, economic, and human welfare impacts, there is limited understanding regarding how environmental managers perceive the problem and subsequently manage alien species. Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires to (1) analyze the extent to which they perceive plant invasions as a problem; (2) identify the status, occurrence, and impacts of noxious alien plant species; (3) assess current effort and expenditure targeting alien plant management; and, finally, (4) identify the criteria they use to set priorities for management. In comparison to other environmental concerns, plant invasions are perceived as only moderately problematic and mechanical control is the most valued and frequently used strategy to cope with plant invasions in Spain. Based on 70 questionnaires received, 193 species are considered noxious, 109 of which have been the subject of management activities. More than 90% of species are found in at least one protected area. According to respondents, the most frequently managed species are the most widespread across administrative regions and the ones perceived as causing the highest impacts. The perception of impact seems to be independent of their invasion status, since only half of the species identified as noxious are believed to be invasive in Spain, while 43% of species thought to only be casual aliens are causing a high impact. Records of management costs are poor and the few data indicate that the total actual expenditure amounted to 50,492,437 € in the last decade. The majority of respondents stated that management measures are insufficient to control alien plants due to limited economic resources, lack of public awareness and support, and an absence of coordination among different public administrations. Managers also expressed their concern about the fact that much scientific research is concerned with the ecology of alien plants rather than with specific cost-efficient strategies to manage alien species.",2009,"English","Peer-reviewed article",NA,"Yes","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Magnoliopsida","Caryophyllales","Aizoaceae","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus sp.",NA,"Ice plant/Sour Fig/Hottentot Fig","Terrestrial","Terrestrial",NA,NA,"other","N","N","Europe","Spain","Spain","Spain","Country","most probably the last decade","Period",1999,2009,1999,2009,"Potentially ongoing","2886683.00",NA,NA,"4600249.28","4590163.79",262425.73,418204.48,417287.62,"EUR",2009,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Control","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires.

Spreading at an average 800 km/year, it is now present in 41 African countries. The socio-economic impacts of Tuta absoluta were assessed through a household survey in Kenya and Zambia in 2018, covering 400 respondents in Kenya and 426 in Zambia. We found that 97.9% of farmers in Zambia, and 99% in Kenya reported Tuta absoluta as the main problem on tomato. A majority of farmers in Zambia (57%) had lost a large proportion of their crop to Tuta absoluta, compared to 41% in Kenya. Mean seasonal production loss based on farmers’ own estimates was 114,000 tonnes for Kenya and 10,700 tonnes for Zambia, equivalent to US$ 59.3, and US$ 8.7 million in economic losses respectively. Pesticides were the predominant control method for Tuta absoluta, used by 96.5% of farmers in Kenya and 97.6% of farmers in Zambia, with 6.4% using highly toxic products. However, only 27.2% and 17.2% of farmers in Kenya and Zambia, respectively, indicated the pesticide treatments were very successful. In Kenya, 73.1% of farmers applied 1-5 sprays/season, and in Zambia 29.2% applied 1-5 sprays, and 33.9% applied 6-10.

An Assessment of Costs and Benefits","Doeleman, J.A.","In the mid 1980s the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) committed itself to a program of biological control of the aquatic weed Salvinia molesto in SriLanka. Salvinia in Sri Lanka interferes with irrigation and drainage of rice paddies, it reducesthe fish catch in water reservoirs and it also poses a health risk in providing additional breeding opportunities for mosquitos. The agent of biological control is a Brazilian weevil called Cyrtobagous solvinioe. Spectacular results with this beetle have already been achieved in Australia, Papua New Guinea and other countries following entomological work during the 1970s in whichthe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) played a pioneering role.This study estimates the economic benefits from the Sri Lankan program. A feasible rangeof net present values were determined over a forward-looking 25-year time horizon. At the midpointof the likely feasible range, the present value of salvinia control is A$16 million (433 million rupees) at 1987 prices. Considering both the Australian and Sri Lankan contribution to theprogram, the estimate represents a return of A$53 (or rupees) per dollar (or rupee) invested. When the same calculation is cast in terms of the value of Sri Lankan labour the ratio is boosted from 53 to a dramatic 1673.The research demonstrates: (a) an effective case of foreign aid; (b) the value of biological controlmethods; and (c) the role of publicly funded research in biological control.",1989,"English","Official report","McConnachie2003","Yes","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Polypodiopsida","Salviniales","Salviniaceae","Salvinia","Salvinia molesta",NA,"Salvinia","Aquatic","Aquatic","reservoirs and drainage systems","11","other","N","Y","Asia","Sri Lanka",NA,"Sri Lanka","Country","1987-2011","Period",1987,2011,1987,2011,"Potentially ongoing","6100000.00","4100000.00","8200000.00","446916.18",NA,244000,17876.65,NA,"LKR",1987,"Effective","Observed","Extrapolation","Fishery","Damage-Loss","Damage",NA,"High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"yes","fishery losses","Jane Catford","No"

Vila M & Hulme PE.","Despite biological invasions being a worldwide phenomenon causing significant ecological, economic, and human welfare impacts, there is limited understanding regarding how environmental managers perceive the problem and subsequently manage alien species. Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires to (1) analyze the extent to which they perceive plant invasions as a problem; (2) identify the status, occurrence, and impacts of noxious alien plant species; (3) assess current effort and expenditure targeting alien plant management; and, finally, (4) identify the criteria they use to set priorities for management. In comparison to other environmental concerns, plant invasions are perceived as only moderately problematic and mechanical control is the most valued and frequently used strategy to cope with plant invasions in Spain. Based on 70 questionnaires received, 193 species are considered noxious, 109 of which have been the subject of management activities. More than 90% of species are found in at least one protected area. According to respondents, the most frequently managed species are the most widespread across administrative regions and the ones perceived as causing the highest impacts. The perception of impact seems to be independent of their invasion status, since only half of the species identified as noxious are believed to be invasive in Spain, while 43% of species thought to only be casual aliens are causing a high impact. Records of management costs are poor and the few data indicate that the total actual expenditure amounted to 50,492,437 € in the last decade. The majority of respondents stated that management measures are insufficient to control alien plants due to limited economic resources, lack of public awareness and support, and an absence of coordination among different public administrations. Managers also expressed their concern about the fact that much scientific research is concerned with the ecology of alien plants rather than with specific cost-efficient strategies to manage alien species.",2009,"English","Peer-reviewed article",NA,"Yes","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Liliopsida","Commelinales","Pontederiaceae","Eichhornia","Eichhornia crassipes",NA,"Water hyacinth","Aquatic","Aquatic",NA,NA,"other","N","N","Europe","Spain","Spain","Spain","Country","most probably the last decade","Period",1999,2009,1999,2009,"Potentially ongoing","6700000.00",NA,NA,"10677192.54","10653784.07",609090.91,970653.87,968525.82,"EUR",2009,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Control","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires.

Spreading at an average 800 km/year, it is now present in 41 African countries. The socio-economic impacts of Tuta absoluta were assessed through a household survey in Kenya and Zambia in 2018, covering 400 respondents in Kenya and 426 in Zambia. We found that 97.9% of farmers in Zambia, and 99% in Kenya reported Tuta absoluta as the main problem on tomato. A majority of farmers in Zambia (57%) had lost a large proportion of their crop to Tuta absoluta, compared to 41% in Kenya. Mean seasonal production loss based on farmers’ own estimates was 114,000 tonnes for Kenya and 10,700 tonnes for Zambia, equivalent to US$ 59.3, and US$ 8.7 million in economic losses respectively. Pesticides were the predominant control method for Tuta absoluta, used by 96.5% of farmers in Kenya and 97.6% of farmers in Zambia, with 6.4% using highly toxic products. However, only 27.2% and 17.2% of farmers in Kenya and Zambia, respectively, indicated the pesticide treatments were very successful. In Kenya, 73.1% of farmers applied 1-5 sprays/season, and in Zambia 29.2% applied 1-5 sprays, and 33.9% applied 6-10. The average amount spent on pesticides per household against Tuta absoluta was US$ 47.2 in Kenya, about US$ 33.7/ha, while in Zambia, this cost was US$ 42.1 per household, and US$ 9.4/ha. The average cost for a pesticide application against Tuta absoluta in Kenya was US$ 12.3, and US$ 4.2 in Zambia.

INNS are increasingly abundant in Great Britain and in Europe generally and their impact is rising. Hence, INNS are the subject of considerable concern in Great Britain, prompting the development of a Non-Native Species Strategy and the formation of the GB Non-Native Species Programme Board and Secretariat. A number of estimates of the economic impact of INNS on various countries, including the UK, exist, but the detail in many of these estimates is lacking and the impact on different sectors of the country is largely unknown. This research estimates the current annual cost of INNS to the British economy. The report provides assessments of the economic cost of INNS to twelve sectors and the report contains detailed examples for three species (Japanese knotweed, signal crayfish and floating pennywort). Five case studies are also included to demonstrate the costs of eradication at different stages of invasion. The report only considers negative economic impacts of INNS, although it is acknowledged that non-native species, including some invasive ones can make a positive contribution to the economy. Various methods were used to secure data for economic estimations. References of relevance to over 500 non-native species were gathered from the scientific and grey literature as well as the internet. A detailed questionnaire was sent to key organisations, primarily to develop contacts but also to gather initial information. The collected information was used to estimate the costs, partially based on calculations for individual species, which was anonymously reviewed by selected experts from each of the sectors.

"IC_2.1_6605","SC1533",NA,"Brundu2014","Plant invaders in European and Mediterranean inland waters: profiles, distribution, and threats","Brundu, G.","The present brief and selective review
focuses on a set of invasive alien aquatic plant species
(notably the 21 listed by the European and Mediterranean
Plant ProtectionOrganisation, i.e., five A2 species,
11 invasive, 2 in the Observation List, 1 in the Alert List,
2 noteworthy), on definitions in use, on introduction
pathways, and ecological effects, although the social
and economic effects of freshwater invaders can be
diverse and substantial. Legislation, literature, and
scientific research dealing with plant invasions in inland
waters often merge different types of invasive plant
species and invaded habitats, as there are some
overlappings between the concepts of macrophyte,
aquatic plants, inland waters, wetlands, and riparian
habitats. Freshwater ecosystems may well be the most
endangered ecosystems in the world. Countless aquatic
plants have been introduced in Europe and in the
Mediterranean region, either deliberately because they
were thought to be ornamental or otherwise desirable, or
accidentally as releases from aquaria, dumping from
water gardens, or contaminants. The escape of alien
plants from managed environments is also frequent.
Aquatic invaders have strong negative impacts on native
biodiversity and many different impacts are reported in
the literature for Europe and worldwide. Plant invasions
in inlandwatersmay be considered as one of a syndrome
of factors that characterize degraded aquatic ecosystems.
There are a number of risk analysis, impact
assessment, ranking systems, decision trees, and prioritization
methods available throughout Europe and the
EPPO region, but the lack of a common framework for
assessing the risks posed by invasive alien aquatic
species is seen as a key gap. Successful management
should include prevention, habitat restoration, dedicated
risk assessment, prioritization, awareness raising, dedicated
legislation, collaboration between different
stakeholders, development of codes of conduct with
the horticultural sector, and prohibiting the sale,
purchase, and intentional release of some species in
the wild. Actions to protect the European and Mediterranean
inland waters from plants invasions are urgently

Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.",2009,"English","Official report",NA,"Yes","Animalia","Chordata","Mammalia","Rodentia","Muridae","Rattus","Rattus sp.",NA,"Diverse/Unspecified","Terrestrial","Terrestrial",NA,NA,"other",NA,"N","North America","United States",NA,"Diverse/Unspecified","Country",NA,"Year",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Potentially ongoing","21200000.00",NA,NA,"24135972.26","24135972.26",21200000,24135972.26,24135972.26,"USD",2008,"Effective","Observed","Report/Estimation","Agriculture","Damage-Loss","Damage",NA,"High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"No","Table 2: Introduced rats (U.S.) Consumption of stored grains, other materials","Nigel Taylor","No"

Vila M & Hulme PE.","Despite biological invasions being a worldwide phenomenon causing significant ecological, economic, and human welfare impacts, there is limited understanding regarding how environmental managers perceive the problem and subsequently manage alien species. Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires to (1) analyze the extent to which they perceive plant invasions as a problem; (2) identify the status, occurrence, and impacts of noxious alien plant species; (3) assess current effort and expenditure targeting alien plant management; and, finally, (4) identify the criteria they use to set priorities for management. In comparison to other environmental concerns, plant invasions are perceived as only moderately problematic and mechanical control is the most valued and frequently used strategy to cope with plant invasions in Spain. Based on 70 questionnaires received, 193 species are considered noxious, 109 of which have been the subject of management activities. More than 90% of species are found in at least one protected area. According to respondents, the most frequently managed species are the most widespread across administrative regions and the ones perceived as causing the highest impacts. The perception of impact seems to be independent of their invasion status, since only half of the species identified as noxious are believed to be invasive in Spain, while 43% of species thought to only be casual aliens are causing a high impact. Records of management costs are poor and the few data indicate that the total actual expenditure amounted to 50,492,437 € in the last decade. The majority of respondents stated that management measures are insufficient to control alien plants due to limited economic resources, lack of public awareness and support, and an absence of coordination among different public administrations. Managers also expressed their concern about the fact that much scientific research is concerned with the ecology of alien plants rather than with specific cost-efficient strategies to manage alien species.",2009,"English","Peer-reviewed article",NA,"Yes","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Magnoliopsida","Myrtales","Myrtaceae","Eucalyptus","Eucalyptus sp.",NA,"Gums","Terrestrial","Terrestrial",NA,NA,"other","N","N","Europe","Spain","Spain","Spain","Country","most probably the last decade","Period",1999,2009,1999,2009,"Potentially ongoing","31528294.00",NA,NA,"50243830.69","50133677.08",2866208.55,4567620.97,4557607.01,"EUR",2009,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Control","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires.

Spreading at an average 800 km/year, it is now present in 41 African countries. The socio-economic impacts of Tuta absoluta were assessed through a household survey in Kenya and Zambia in 2018, covering 400 respondents in Kenya and 426 in Zambia. We found that 97.9% of farmers in Zambia, and 99% in Kenya reported Tuta absoluta as the main problem on tomato. A majority of farmers in Zambia (57%) had lost a large proportion of their crop to Tuta absoluta, compared to 41% in Kenya. Mean seasonal production loss based on farmers’ own estimates was 114,000 tonnes for Kenya and 10,700 tonnes for Zambia, equivalent to US$ 59.3, and US$ 8.7 million in economic losses respectively. Pesticides were the predominant control method for Tuta absoluta, used by 96.5% of farmers in Kenya and 97.6% of farmers in Zambia, with 6.4% using highly toxic products. However, only 27.2% and 17.2% of farmers in Kenya and Zambia, respectively, indicated the pesticide treatments were very successful. In Kenya, 73.1% of farmers applied 1-5 sprays/season, and in Zambia 29.2% applied 1-5 sprays, and 33.9% applied 6-10. The average amount spent on pesticides per household against Tuta absoluta was US$ 47.2 in Kenya, about US$ 33.7/ha, while in Zambia, this cost was US$ 42.1 per household, and US$ 9.4/ha.

The introduction of invasive alien species is considered to be one of the most serious threats to global biodiversity. Alien species can also have substantial economic and social impacts.
People have moved plant and animal species to new areas throughout history: often, this has been for our own benefit, to use them as agricultural crops or livestock. In many cases, the consequences of such introductions have been mainly positive or neutral.
More recently, there has been a considerable rise in introductions of alien species, particularly as a result of changes in international patterns of transport and trade. This has resulted in growing awareness of the negative impacts certain species can have when they are introduced outside their natural distribution ranges.
In Norway, too, the introduction and spread of invasive alien species is a serious and growing threat to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and has already inflicted heavy costs on society.
Dealing with alien species involves a complex set of challenges. Most introduced species are not able to survive and spread in the wild. Others become established without harming the ecosystems where they are introduced. But some species both become established and cause significant damage to ecosystems, for example by displacing native species or spreading disease. These are known as invasive alien species, and they can have very serious negative impacts, both on ecosystems and biodiversity and on industries such as agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture that are based on the use of these ecosystems.
Measures to address the problem of invasive alien species in Norway will also be important in efforts to achieve the target of halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. Under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Norway has undertaken as far as possible and as appropriate to prevent the introduction of, control or eradicate those alien species which threaten ecosystems, habitats or species.
Many different bodies in a range of administrative sectors are responsible for action to address the problem of alien species and for administration and enforcement of legislation relating to the introduction, spread, and management and control of alien species. Effective action to reduce the threat from alien species therefore requires targeted and coordinated cross-sectoral efforts. The decision to draw up a cross-sectoral national strategy on alien species was taken in the 2005 white paper on the government’s environmental policy and the state of the environment in Norway (Report No. 21 (2004–2005) to the Storting) and the subsequent debate in the Storting.
This document describes Norway’s goals and principles for dealing with alien species and specific measures that will be implemented in all relevant administrative sectors. The strategy is intended to ensure that there is a common understanding and",2007,"English","Official report",NA,"Yes","Animalia","Arthropoda","Insecta","Diptera","Agromyzidae","Liriomyza","Liriomyza huidobrensis",NA,"serpentine leaf miner","Terrestrial","Terrestrial",NA,NA,"other",NA,"N","Europe","Norway",NA,"Diverse/Unspecified","Country","2002","Year",2002,2002,2002,2002,"Potentially ongoing","45000000.00","40000000.00","50000000.00","9075723.36","5956272.53",4.5e+07,9075723.36,5956272.53,"NOK",2007,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Agriculture","Control/Eradication","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","pp10 and pp13: ""Efforts to eradicate the South American leafminer Liriomyza huidobrensis cost the horticulture industry NOK 40–50 million in 2002.

INNS are increasingly abundant in Great Britain and in Europe generally and their impact is rising. Hence, INNS are the subject of considerable concern in Great Britain, prompting the development of a Non-Native Species Strategy and the formation of the GB Non-Native Species Programme Board and Secretariat. A number of estimates of the economic impact of INNS on various countries, including the UK, exist, but the detail in many of these estimates is lacking and the impact on different sectors of the country is largely unknown. This research estimates the current annual cost of INNS to the British economy. The report provides assessments of the economic cost of INNS to twelve sectors and the report contains detailed examples for three species (Japanese knotweed, signal crayfish and floating pennywort). Five case studies are also included to demonstrate the costs of eradication at different stages of invasion. The report only considers negative economic impacts of INNS, although it is acknowledged that non-native species, including some invasive ones can make a positive contribution to the economy. Various methods were used to secure data for economic estimations. References of relevance to over 500 non-native species were gathered from the scientific and grey literature as well as the internet. A detailed questionnaire was sent to key organisations, primarily to develop contacts but also to gather initial information. The collected information was used to estimate the costs, partially based on calculations for individual species, which was anonymously reviewed by selected experts from each of the sectors. The total current annual cost of INNS to the British economy is estimated, when corrected for double counting, at £1,291,461,000 to England, £244,736,000 to Scotland and £125,118,000 to Wales. Therefore the total annual cost of INNS to the British economy is estimated at approximately £1.7 billion.",2010,"English","Official report",NA,"Yes","Animalia","Nematoda","Chromadorea","Rhabditida","Heteroderidae","Globodera","Globodera pallida/Globodera rostochiensis",NA,"potato cyst nematode","Terrestrial","Terrestrial","agriculture","12b","other",NA,"Y","Europe","United Kingdom",NA,"England/Wales/Scotland","Country","Year","Year",2010,NA,2010,2010,"Potentially ongoing","50000000.00",NA,NA,"86847299.80","80031124.42",5e+07,86847299.8,80031124.42,"GBP",2010,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Agriculture","Control/Damage-Loss","Mixed",NA,"High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","pp64: product cost of nematicides + yield loss.

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention.

15 of these regionally managed species are

that their management does not have a scientific

billion per annum, based on an analysis made in
1984, but this analysis is hampered by a lack of both
objective data on the impacts of weeds on pastoral
production and an accurate and comprehensive national

naturalisations, from an existing pool of exotic plant
species estimated currently at 25 000, and new arrivals
through international trade in plant species
and germplasm, can be expected to steadily add
to the list of pastoral weeds. Prioritisation of these
weed species will be necessary if New Zealand's
pastoral agricultural industries are to make longterm,
economically optimal decisions about their

INNS are increasingly abundant in Great Britain and in Europe generally and their impact is rising. Hence, INNS are the subject of considerable concern in Great Britain, prompting the development of a Non-Native Species Strategy and the formation of the GB Non-Native Species Programme Board and Secretariat. A number of estimates of the economic impact of INNS on various countries, including the UK, exist, but the detail in many of these estimates is lacking and the impact on different sectors of the country is largely unknown. This research estimates the current annual cost of INNS to the British economy. The report provides assessments of the economic cost of INNS to twelve sectors and the report contains detailed examples for three species (Japanese knotweed, signal crayfish and floating pennywort). Five case studies are also included to demonstrate the costs of eradication at different stages of invasion. The report only considers negative economic impacts of INNS, although it is acknowledged that non-native species, including some invasive ones can make a positive contribution to the economy. Various methods were used to secure data for economic estimations. References of relevance to over 500 non-native species were gathered from the scientific and grey literature as well as the internet. A detailed questionnaire was sent to key organisations, primarily to develop contacts but also to gather initial information.

Alien Invaders in Canada’s Waters, Wetlands, and Forests)","Dawson M.","[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] Invasive alien species have been reported to cause serious damage to agriculture, forestry, and the environment in many countries, including Canada. International actions to reduce the spread and damage of all invasive species are currently being undertaken under the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity to which Canada is a party. Plant quarantine pests are invasive alien pests that are capable of causing economic damage to agricultural crops or forest trees. These pests, which are classified as either absent or of restricted distribution in Canada, are controlled by the application of specific regulations aimed at preventing their artificial spread by human means (FAO 1999). Included in the classification are insects, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses, and weeds; to date, weeds have not been subjected to quarantine actions.

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada’s Land Base Resources
Each year Canada’s agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2). Damage resulting from past introductions of harmful invasive plant pests is currently estimated to be $7.3 billion annually (Table 1). Examples of the impacts of quarantine plant pests are presented here according to the activities or amenities affected: agriculture, forestry, the environment, and trade.

Agriculture
A large number of pests of agricultural crops have been introduced in the past 100 years causing catastrophic damage to a wide range of cultivated species. Noteworthy examples include the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber) Behrens), oriental fruit moth (Grapho lita molesta (Busck)), dwarf bunt (Tilletia controversa Kühn), and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera gly cines Ichinohe). Golden nematode is a major pest of potatoes in cool-temperate regions; it attacks the roots of the potato plants, causing thefoliage to yellow, wilt, and die. The oriental fruit moth…

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.",2009,"English","Official report",NA,"Yes","Plantae","Mixed","Mixed","Diverse/Unspecified","Diverse/Unspecified","Diverse/Unspecified","Diverse/Unspecified",NA,"Diverse/Unspecified","Aquatic","Aquatic",NA,NA,"other",NA,"N","North America","United States",NA,"Diverse/Unspecified","Country",NA,"Year",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Potentially ongoing","122000000.00",NA,NA,"138895689.40","138895689.40",1.22e+08,138895689.4,138895689.4,"USD",2008,"Effective","Observed","Report/Estimation","Mixed","Control/Damage-Loss","Mixed",NA,"High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"No","Table 2: Aquatic weeds (U.S.) Losses, damages, control costs","Nigel Taylor","No"

pesticide resistance have increased calls for sustainable pest
management. Biological control offers sustainable pest suppression,
partly because evolution of resistance to predators and
parasitoids is prevented by several factors (e.g., spatial or temporal
refuges from attacks, reciprocal evolution by control agents,
and contrasting selection pressures from other enemy species).
However, evolution of resistance may become more probable as
agricultural intensification reduces the availability of refuges and
diversity of enemy species, or if control agents have genetic
barriers to evolution. Here we use 21 y of field data from 196 sites
across New Zealand to show that parasitism of a key pasture pest
(Listronotus bonariensis; Argentine stem weevil) by an introduced
parasitoid (Microctonus hyperodae) was initially nationally successful
but then declined by 44% (leading to pasture damage of
c. 160 million New Zealand dollars per annum). This decline was
not attributable to parasitoid numbers released, elevation, or local
climatic variables at sample locations. Rather, in all locations the
decline began 7 y (14 host generations) following parasitoid introduction,
despite releases being staggered across locations in
different years. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that declining
parasitism rates occurred in ryegrass Lolium perenne,
which is grown nationwide in high-intensity was significantly less
than in adjacent plots of a less-common pasture grass (Lolium
multiflorum), indicating that resistance to parasitism is host
plant–dependent. We conclude that low plant and enemy biodiversity
in intensive large-scale agriculture may facilitate the evolution
of host resistance by pests and threaten the long-term

Before the deployment of the system, managers were unable to record, in any detail, information relating to the costs associated with areas cleared at different densities for a range of species. As a result of this, only superficial estimates of the impact of theWorking forWater programme have been possible hitherto. While the system is not yet in full operation, data for about 60% of project expenditure from the 2002/03 financial year were available, and we used this information on which to base our analysis. These data show that the costs of clearing rise sharply with the density of invasion, reaching more that R2000/ha in some cases. These amounts do not include expenditure on herbicides, which can reach over R1000/ha for dense infestations of sprouting species. A large proportion (57%) of the costs was incurred in clearing large trees, which are perceived to have a significant influence on water resources. Large sums were also justifiably spent on species that probably are not substantial water users, including lantana, triffid weed and cacti. These plants affect biodiversity, catchment stability, and the agricultural potential of land. Some of the species on which large amounts have been spent, however, are arguably not a priority. Good progress has been made with clearing certain species. At current rates of clearing, however, many other species will not be brought under control within the next half century. This underscores both the importance of biological control as a sustainable, effective and inexpensive solution to the most intractable of the invasive alien plant problems, and the need for landowners to share the responsibility for clearing.

The introduction of invasive alien species is considered to be one of the most serious threats to global biodiversity. Alien species can also have substantial economic and social impacts.
People have moved plant and animal species to new areas throughout history: often, this has been for our own benefit, to use them as agricultural crops or livestock. In many cases, the consequences of such introductions have been mainly positive or neutral.
More recently, there has been a considerable rise in introductions of alien species, particularly as a result of changes in international patterns of transport and trade. This has resulted in growing awareness of the negative impacts certain species can have when they are introduced outside their natural distribution ranges.
In Norway, too, the introduction and spread of invasive alien species is a serious and growing threat to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and has already inflicted heavy costs on society.
Dealing with alien species involves a complex set of challenges. Most introduced species are not able to survive and spread in the wild. Others become established without harming the ecosystems where they are introduced. But some species both become established and cause significant damage to ecosystems, for example by displacing native species or spreading disease. These are known as invasive alien species, and they can have very serious negative impacts, both on ecosystems and biodiversity and on industries such as agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture that are based on the use of these ecosystems.
Measures to address the problem of invasive alien species in Norway will also be important in efforts to achieve the target of halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. Under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Norway has undertaken as far as possible and as appropriate to prevent the introduction of, control or eradicate those alien species which threaten ecosystems, habitats or species.
Many different bodies in a range of administrative sectors are responsible for action to address the problem of alien species and for administration and enforcement of legislation relating to the introduction, spread, and management and control of alien species. Effective action to reduce the threat from alien species therefore requires targeted and coordinated cross-sectoral efforts. The decision to draw up a cross-sectoral national strategy on alien species was taken in the 2005 white paper on the government’s environmental policy and the state of the environment in Norway (Report No. 21 (2004–2005) to the Storting) and the subsequent debate in the Storting.
This document describes Norway’s goals and principles for dealing with alien species and specific measures that will be implemented in all relevant administrative sectors. The strategy is intended to ensure that there is a common understanding and",2007,"English","Official report",NA,"Yes","Animalia","Platyhelminthes","Monogenea","Gyrodactylidea","Gyrodactylidae","Gyrodactylus","Gyrodactylus salaris",NA,"salmon fluke","Aquatic","Aquatic","Norwegian river systems","11","other",NA,"N","Europe","Norway",NA,NA,"Country","Year","Year",NA,NA,2007,2007,"Potentially ongoing","225000000.00","200000000.00","250000000.00","45378616.79","29781362.67",2.25e+08,45378616.79,29781362.67,"NOK",2007,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Mixed","Damage-Loss","Damage",NA,"High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","NOTE OVERLAP WITH OTHER GYRODACTYLUS COST FROM THIS SOURCE. pp10 and pp19: ""Gyrodactylus now causes annual losses in the order of NOK 200–250 million in Norwegian river systems.""

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.",2009,"English","Official report",NA,"Yes","Animalia","Chordata","Mammalia","Rodentia","Muridae","Rattus","Rattus sp.",NA,"Diverse/Unspecified","Terrestrial","Terrestrial",NA,NA,"other",NA,"N","North America","United States",NA,"Diverse/Unspecified","Country",NA,"Year",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Potentially ongoing","229000000.00",NA,NA,"260714039.94","260714039.94",2.29e+08,260714039.94,260714039.94,"USD",2008,"Effective","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Damage-Loss","Damage",NA,"High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"No","Table 2: Introduced rats (U.S.) Loss of market due to quarantines","Nigel Taylor","No"

INNS are increasingly abundant in Great Britain and in Europe generally and their impact is rising. Hence, INNS are the subject of considerable concern in Great Britain, prompting the development of a Non-Native Species Strategy and the formation of the GB Non-Native Species Programme Board and Secretariat. A number of estimates of the economic impact of INNS on various countries, including the UK, exist, but the detail in many of these estimates is lacking and the impact on different sectors of the country is largely unknown. This research estimates the current annual cost of INNS to the British economy. The report provides assessments of the economic cost of INNS to twelve sectors and the report contains detailed examples for three species (Japanese knotweed, signal crayfish and floating pennywort). Five case studies are also included to demonstrate the costs of eradication at different stages of invasion. The report only considers negative economic impacts of INNS, although it is acknowledged that non-native species, including some invasive ones can make a positive contribution to the economy. Various methods were used to secure data for economic estimations. References of relevance to over 500 non-native species were gathered from the scientific and grey literature as well as the internet. A detailed questionnaire was sent to key organisations, primarily to develop contacts but also to gather initial information. The collected information was used to estimate the costs, partially based on calculations for individual species, which was anonymously reviewed by selected experts from each of the sectors. The total current annual cost of INNS to the British economy is estimated, when corrected for double counting, at £1,291,461,000 to England, £244,736,000 to Scotland and £125,118,000 to Wales. Therefore the total annual cost of INNS to the British economy is estimated at approximately £1.7 billion.",2010,"English","Official report",NA,"Yes","Diverse/Unspecified","Mixed","Mixed","Diverse/Unspecified","Diverse/Unspecified","Diverse/Unspecified","Diverse/Unspecified",NA,"Diverse/Unspecified","Terrestrial","Terrestrial","agriculture","12b","other",NA,"Y","Europe","United Kingdom",NA,"England/Wales/Scotland","Country","Year","Year",2010,NA,2010,2010,"Potentially ongoing","281903000.00",NA,NA,"489650287.14","451220281.36",281903000,489650287.14,451220281.36,"GBP",2010,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Agriculture","Damage-Loss","Damage",NA,"High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","Table 5.10 Cost of yield loss due to non-native plant pathogens.

Alien Invaders in Canada’s Waters, Wetlands, and Forests)","Dawson M.","[FIRST PAGE OF TEXT] Invasive alien species have been reported to cause serious damage to agriculture, forestry, and the environment in many countries, including Canada. International actions to reduce the spread and damage of all invasive species are currently being undertaken under the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity to which Canada is a party. Plant quarantine pests are invasive alien pests that are capable of causing economic damage to agricultural crops or forest trees. These pests, which are classified as either absent or of restricted distribution in Canada, are controlled by the application of specific regulations aimed at preventing their artificial spread by human means (FAO 1999). Included in the classification are insects, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses, and weeds; to date, weeds have not been subjected to quarantine actions.

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada’s Land Base Resources
Each year Canada’s agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2). Damage resulting from past introductions of harmful invasive plant pests is currently estimated to be $7.3 billion annually (Table 1). Examples of the impacts of quarantine plant pests are presented here according to the activities or amenities affected: agriculture, forestry, the environment, and trade.

Agriculture
A large number of pests of agricultural crops have been introduced in the past 100 years causing catastrophic damage to a wide range of cultivated species. Noteworthy examples include the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber) Behrens), oriental fruit moth (Grapho lita molesta (Busck)), dwarf bunt (Tilletia controversa Kühn), and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera gly cines Ichinohe). Golden nematode is a major pest of potatoes in cool-temperate regions; it attacks the roots of the potato plants, causing thefoliage to yellow, wilt, and die. The oriental fruit moth…

species, almost all exotic in origin, occurring as
""weeds"" in pastures in New Zealand. Judging from their occurrence in scientific papers published in the
proceedings of the New Zealand Plant Protection
Society, 65 of these species are, or have been considered
historically, to be significant pastoral weeds.
While 34 of these pastoral weeds are currently being
managed under Regional Pest Management Strategies,
15 of these regionally managed species are
apparently un-researched in New Zealand, implying
that their management does not have a scientific
basis. The aggregate cost of pastoral weeds to the
New Zealand economy is estimated to be NZ$1.2
billion per annum, based on an analysis made in
1984, but this analysis is hampered by a lack of both
objective data on the impacts of weeds on pastoral
production and an accurate and comprehensive national
census of the main problem species. Ongoing
naturalisations, from an existing pool of exotic plant
species estimated currently at 25 000, and new arrivals
through international trade in plant species
and germplasm, can be expected to steadily add
to the list of pastoral weeds. Prioritisation of these
weed species will be necessary if New Zealand's
pastoral agricultural industries are to make longterm,
economically optimal decisions about their
management. Such prioritisation will require robust

Spreading at an average 800 km/year, it is now present in 41 African countries. The socio-economic impacts of Tuta absoluta were assessed through a household survey in Kenya and Zambia in 2018, covering 400 respondents in Kenya and 426 in Zambia. We found that 97.9% of farmers in Zambia, and 99% in Kenya reported Tuta absoluta as the main problem on tomato. A majority of farmers in Zambia (57%) had lost a large proportion of their crop to Tuta absoluta, compared to 41% in Kenya. Mean seasonal production loss based on farmers’ own estimates was 114,000 tonnes for Kenya and 10,700 tonnes for Zambia, equivalent to US$ 59.3, and US$ 8.7 million in economic losses respectively. Pesticides were the predominant control method for Tuta absoluta, used by 96.5% of farmers in Kenya and 97.6% of farmers in Zambia, with 6.4% using highly toxic products.

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada’s Land Base Resources
Each year Canada’s agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2).

Examples of the impacts of quarantine plant pests are presented here according to the activities or amenities affected: agriculture, forestry, the environment, and trade.

Agriculture
A large number of pests of agricultural crops have been introduced in the past 100 years causing catastrophic damage to a wide range of cultivated species. Noteworthy examples include the golden nematode (Globodera rostochiensis (Wollenweber) Behrens), oriental fruit moth (Grapho lita molesta (Busck)), dwarf bunt (Tilletia controversa Kühn), and soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera gly cines Ichinohe). Golden nematode is a major pest of potatoes in cool-temperate regions; it attacks the roots of the potato plants, causing thefoliage to yellow, wilt, and die. The oriental fruit moth…

Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. Decisions about agricultural production, conversion of land from forest to fields to towns, the growth of trade and tourism, and the choice of introduced species for food production, garden ornamentals, and for hunting and fishing are among the fundamental economic drivers of the invasive species problem. Economics provides us with many of the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and inform managers and policymakers about the costs of invasive species and the costs and benefits of different prevention, eradication, and control measures. Studies have been carried out to estimate the economic effects of invasive species and their management on natural resources. These have been particularly focused on forest or agricultural production losses and control costs, but the economic impacts on ecosystem functioning and human health have been less well studied at both state and national levels. Examples of estimates of the annual cost of invasive species in the U.S. and Oregon (in 2008 dollars) are shown in the chart below. Although these studies provide policymakers with important information with which to make decisions, inconsistency in study methodologies limits the usability and comparability of these studies in making policy decisions. A much wider role for economics is needed that goes beyond financial analyses of agricultural or timber production losses and control costs and embraces measures of the impact of invasive species on total economic value and the consequences of the loss or impairment of ecosystem services for the economic well-being of Oregon. Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and prevention are among the most cost-efficient and -effective ways of reducing the costs of invasive species. Education is a primary process driving EDRR and prevention. Enhanced education of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations is needed to strengthen all links in the invasive species management chain.",2009,"English","Official report",NA,"Yes","Animalia","Mollusca","Bivalvia","Myida","Dreissenidae","Dreissena","Dreissena polymorpha",NA,"Zebra mussel","Aquatic","Aquatic",NA,"10\11","other",NA,"N","North America","United States",NA,"Diverse/Unspecified","Country",NA,"Year",NA,NA,2009,2009,"Potentially ongoing","1120000000.00",NA,NA,"1275107968.25","1275107968.25",1.12e+09,1275107968.25,1275107968.25,"USD",2008,"Effective","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Control/Damage-Loss","Mixed",NA,"High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"No","Table 2: Zebra mussels (U.S.) Damage to infrastructure, control costs","Nigel Taylor","No"

Impact of Plant Quarantine Pests on Canada’s Land Base Resources
Each year Canada’s agricultural and forest land base produces $86 billion worth of plant products (forestry, $71 billion; agriculture, $15 billion), which sustain industries providing about 762 000 jobs. In past years, numerous plant quarantine pests have entered and become established in Canada with devastating effects on agricultural crops (Appendix 1) and forest trees (Appendix 2).

The introduction of invasive alien species is considered to be one of the most serious threats to global biodiversity. Alien species can also have substantial economic and social impacts.
People have moved plant and animal species to new areas throughout history: often, this has been for our own benefit, to use them as agricultural crops or livestock. In many cases, the consequences of such introductions have been mainly positive or neutral.
More recently, there has been a considerable rise in introductions of alien species, particularly as a result of changes in international patterns of transport and trade. This has resulted in growing awareness of the negative impacts certain species can have when they are introduced outside their natural distribution ranges.
In Norway, too, the introduction and spread of invasive alien species is a serious and growing threat to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and has already inflicted heavy costs on society.
Dealing with alien species involves a complex set of challenges. Most introduced species are not able to survive and spread in the wild. Others become established without harming the ecosystems where they are introduced. But some species both become established and cause significant damage to ecosystems, for example by displacing native species or spreading disease. These are known as invasive alien species, and they can have very serious negative impacts, both on ecosystems and biodiversity and on industries such as agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture that are based on the use of these ecosystems.
Measures to address the problem of invasive alien species in Norway will also be important in efforts to achieve the target of halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. Under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Norway has undertaken as far as possible and as appropriate to prevent the introduction of, control or eradicate those alien species which threaten ecosystems, habitats or species.
Many different bodies in a range of administrative sectors are responsible for action to address the problem of alien species and for administration and enforcement of legislation relating to the introduction, spread, and management and control of alien species. Effective action to reduce the threat from alien species therefore requires targeted and coordinated cross-sectoral efforts. The decision to draw up a cross-sectoral national strategy on alien species was taken in the 2005 white paper on the government’s environmental policy and the state of the environment in Norway (Report No. 21 (2004–2005) to the Storting) and the subsequent debate in the Storting.
This document describes Norway’s goals and principles for dealing with alien species and specific measures that will be implemented in all relevant administrative sectors.

This includes the initial assessment of the problem and a survey of indigenous natural enemies, foreign surveys, the study and clearance of the most promising control organisms, and up through initial release. Using estimates of the costs and benefits from the successful alligatorweed project (Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb. ), plus examples of several terrestrial biological control of weeds projects, further support for research on classical biological control is economically justified. In addition to the classical approach, biological control of weeds may also be implemented through the use of non-selective weed feeders (e.g., in the case of aquatic weeds, herbivorous fish, crayfish, snails) although periodic surveillance and manipulation are required to avoid unwanted side effects and optimize weed control.

This study evaluates the economic impacts of tamarisk (Tamarix sp.), an invasive woody shrub, on societally-valued ecosystem services in its naturalized range. Tamarisk, intentionally introduced from Eurasia, has invaded most riparian areas of the arid and semiarid western United States. In its naturalized range, tamarisk consumes more water than native vegetation, with significant economic implications in a region marked by water scarcity. Tamarisk also increases sedimentation in river channels, leading to increased frequency and severity of flood damage. Conservative economic estimates of these impacts indicate that the annual costs of tamarisk to the western United States total USD 280–450 ha–1. Eradicating the invader and restoring native riparian communities throughout the region would cost approximately USD 7400 ha–1. Full recovery of these costs, even with a highly conservative benefits estimate, would occur in as few as 17 years, after which the societal, ecological, and economic benefits of restoration would continue to accrue indefinitely.",2000,"English","Peer-reviewed article",NA,"Yes","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Magnoliopsida","Caryophyllales","Tamaricaceae","Tamarix","Tamarix sp.",NA,NA,"Terrestrial","Terrestrial","Riparian floodplain","9","other","N","N","North America","United States",NA,"Semiarid Western United States","Country","1998-2018","Year",1998,2018,1998,2018,"Potentially ongoing","209000000.00","127000000.00","291000000.00","314278367.67","314278367.67",2.09e+08,314278367.67,314278367.67,"USD",1998,"Effective","Observed","Report/Estimation","Mixed","Indirect costs","Damage",NA,"High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","Estimates the annual cost with loss of ecosystem services (e.g., irrigation water, municipal water, hydropower, flood control)","Gustavo Heringer","No"

Vila M & Hulme PE.","Despite biological invasions being a worldwide phenomenon causing significant ecological, economic, and human welfare impacts, there is limited understanding regarding how environmental managers perceive the problem and subsequently manage alien species. Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires to (1) analyze the extent to which they perceive plant invasions as a problem; (2) identify the status, occurrence, and impacts of noxious alien plant species; (3) assess current effort and expenditure targeting alien plant management; and, finally, (4) identify the criteria they use to set priorities for management. In comparison to other environmental concerns, plant invasions are perceived as only moderately problematic and mechanical control is the most valued and frequently used strategy to cope with plant invasions in Spain. Based on 70 questionnaires received, 193 species are considered noxious, 109 of which have been the subject of management activities. More than 90% of species are found in at least one protected area. According to respondents, the most frequently managed species are the most widespread across administrative regions and the ones perceived as causing the highest impacts. The perception of impact seems to be independent of their invasion status, since only half of the species identified as noxious are believed to be invasive in Spain, while 43% of species thought to only be casual aliens are causing a high impact. Records of management costs are poor and the few data indicate that the total actual expenditure amounted to 50,492,437 € in the last decade. The majority of respondents stated that management measures are insufficient to control alien plants due to limited economic resources, lack of public awareness and support, and an absence of coordination among different public administrations. Managers also expressed their concern about the fact that much scientific research is concerned with the ecology of alien plants rather than with specific cost-efficient strategies to manage alien species.",2009,"English","Peer-reviewed article",NA,"Yes","Plantae","Tracheophyta","Magnoliopsida","Asterales","Asteraceae","Senecio","Senecio inaequidens",NA,"Narrow-leaved ragwort/Guano bush/Small-leaved groundsel/South African ragwort/Groundsel","Terrestrial","Terrestrial",NA,NA,"other","N","N","Europe","Spain","Spain","Spain","Country","most probably the last decade","Period",1999,2009,1999,2009,"Potentially ongoing","19600.00",NA,NA,"31234.77","31166.29",1781.82,2839.52,2833.3,"EUR",2009,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Control","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","Spanish environmental managers were surveyed using questionnaires.

INNS are increasingly abundant in Great Britain and in Europe generally and their impact is rising. Hence, INNS are the subject of considerable concern in Great Britain, prompting the development of a Non-Native Species Strategy and the formation of the GB Non-Native Species Programme Board and Secretariat. A number of estimates of the economic impact of INNS on various countries, including the UK, exist, but the detail in many of these estimates is lacking and the impact on different sectors of the country is largely unknown. This research estimates the current annual cost of INNS to the British economy. The report provides assessments of the economic cost of INNS to twelve sectors and the report contains detailed examples for three species (Japanese knotweed, signal crayfish and floating pennywort). Five case studies are also included to demonstrate the costs of eradication at different stages of invasion. The report only considers negative economic impacts of INNS, although it is acknowledged that non-native species, including some invasive ones can make a positive contribution to the economy. Various methods were used to secure data for economic estimations. References of relevance to over 500 non-native species were gathered from the scientific and grey literature as well as the internet. A detailed questionnaire was sent to key organisations, primarily to develop contacts but also to gather initial information. The collected information was used to estimate the costs, partially based on calculations for individual species, which was anonymously reviewed by selected experts from each of the sectors.

Larkin; Jennifer Sweeney Tookes;and Tracy Yandle","Invasive lionfish are affecting reef ecosystems along the Gulf Coast and Caribbean. By establishing commercial fisheries and harvesting lionfish in mass, it may be possible to reduce their ecological footprint in the region. Nonetheless, there has been little research assessing the viability of a consumer market for lionfish meat. Using data collected in the US Virgin Islands (USVI), this study examines individuals’ willingness to participate in a hypothetical market for lionfish meat and their potential consumption levels. Consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for lionfish meat is also estimated. Findings suggest that individuals’ market participation and consumption levels are correlated with concerns for food safety and the environment, and consumer WTP is compatible with dockside prices of other species of reef fish.

Described as Europe’s most invasive fish, P. parva presents a risk to native fishes through the transmission of a novel pathogen and undesirable impacts arising from processes including increased inter-specific competition. Populations have been recorded in 32 UK waters since their first recording outside of aquaculture in 1996; the majority are lakes <5 ha used for recreational angling in England. The aims of the control programme were to develop a basic evaluation framework that assesses populations by risk (high, medium and low), determine commensurate management actions according to that risk and then execute those actions. For populations assessed as ‘high-risk’, for example those that could result in P. parva dispersal into a river catchment, eradication was determined as the commensurate management action and six operations have since been completed, principally using rotenone, and all have been successful to date. For P. parva populations in sites evaluated as lower risk, techniques such as biomanipulation were determined as more appropriate actions and have been used to successfully reduce their abundance by >99%.

As additional financial supportwas  required  to  carry  out  the  newprogrammes,  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,Government of India, was approached forspecific projects under the CBI’s Plan. Thusthe first project cleared by the Ministry wasa scheme to provide pesticide and plant pro-tection equipment to the smallholder grow-ers, which was launched during November1991.  Under  this  project,  pesticide  andsprayers were supplied to smallholder grow-ers at subsidized rates.In order to intensify the studies on devel-oping an integrated management packagefor coffee berry borer with more focus onbiological  measures,  another  project,  theBiological Control of Berry Borer, was initi-ated  during  May  1993.  Studies  were  con-ducted  on  the  possibilities  of  usingbiocontrol  agents  in  the  management  ofberry borer and studies were initiated onthe indigenous fungal pathogen, Beauveriabassiana.  Simultaneously,  attempts  werealso initiated to import some exotic parasi-toids of the borer as there was no parasi-toid recorded from India. Two parasitoids,Cephalonomia  stephanoderis  and  Proropsnasuta were introduced from Mexico dur-ing September 1995, and two entomologistswere trained on the mass multiplication ofthe parasitoids at ECOSUR (El Colegio de laFrontera  Sur),  Tapachula,  Mexico.  Fromthese   activities,   a   culture   of   C.stephanoderis was established in India.The Scientific Advisory Committee of theMinistry of Commerce under the Chairman-ship  of  Dr.  M.S.  Swaminathan  recom-mended, during August 1994, to considerthe CBB as a national pest and implement aproject that had a mission mode approachto intensify the ongoing programmes in amore effective way.   Thus, the Ministry ofCommerce  sanctioned  a  project,  the  ‘Na-tional  Mission  on  Control  and  Preventionof  Coffee  Berry  Borer’,  during  December1995 for a period of three years. All the ex-isting programmes on CBB were integratedinto this new project and new research andextension  programmes  were  also  started.This  resulted  in  the  emergence  of  a  pack-age of practices for the management of thepest, and the creation of awareness amonggrowers  on  the  importance  of  taking  uptimely measures for  tackling the pest. Theproject  was  continued  as  an  ongoingprogramme during the IX Plan Period (1997-98 to 2001-02).As the CBB is a serious pest problem in mostof the leading coffee growing countries inthe world, and the fact that much progresshad been achieved in research in biocontrolof CBB in Colombia and Mexico, the CoffeeBoard approached the International CoffeeOrganisation  (ICO)  to  initiate  an  interna-tional project on the pest.The ICO took an initiative in this direction,and during November 1995 a consultant, Dr.J.  A.  Nicholas  Wallis  was  sent  to  India  toprepare a draft proposal for an internationalproject. CABI Bioscience was identified as theProject  Executing  Agency  (PEA)  for  imple-mentation of the project, and the CommonFund for Commodities (CFC) agreed to pro-vide funds. The details of the project wereworked out in a meeting of the participat-ing countries (India, Colombia, Mexico, Ec-uador, Guatemala, Honduras and Jamaica)with CABI Bioscience and the CFC at the ICO,London during July 1996. The Project waslaunched  in  January  1998  for  a  period  ofthree years, which was later extended to De-cember 2001. This project provided an op-portunity for research and extension person-nel to have first hand knowledge of the lat-est  developments  in  CBB  managementworldwide. The technology of mass breed-ing CBB parasitoids developed at Cenicafé,Colombia  was  made  available  to  Indiathrough training to researchers.  Addition-ally,  two  parasitoids,  Phymastichus  coffeaand  Prorops  nasuta  were  imported  fromColombia under this project. A farmer par-ticipatory approach was highlighted in theprocess  of  technology  development  andimplementation.

plants including aquatic species. This paper presents an overview of the history and current governance of aquatic invasive
species management in New Zealand. Its main focus is the input of biosecurity science, focussing primarily on the proactive
management of invasive freshwater plants, and application in Australasia and other Pacific nations. Examples of proactive
management actions include; identification of invasive species off-shore to prevent importation, management at the border,
mitigation of introduction/dispersal pathways, surveillance for new incursions, incursion response and national eradication
programs. Many of these actions are informed and supported by the development and application of risk assessment tools.
The success of these initiatives within New Zealand is aided by geographical isolation and a relatively small population size,
recognition of the need to protect an economy based on primary production from invasive species, strong effective legislation
and biosecurity science directly linked to policy and management.",2018,"English","Conference proceedings",NA,"Yes","Animalia","Arthropoda","Insecta","Diptera","Culicidae","Aedes","Aedes camptorhynchus",NA,"southern saltmarsh mosquito","Mixed","Aquatic/Terrestrial",NA,NA,"other","N","Y","Oceania","New Zealand",NA,"New Zealand","Country","Since 1998","Period",1998,2010,1998,2010,"One-time","70000000.00",NA,NA,"47279408.69","47961546.65",5384615.38,3636877.59,3689349.74,"NZD",2018,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Health","Eradication","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","In June 2010, MPI (Ministry for Primary Industries) declared that the Notifiable

enemies contributes significantly to sustained, cost-effective management of natural resources
in South Africa. The status of, and prospects for, biological control is therefore integral to
National Status Reports (NSRs) on Biological Invasions, the first of which is due in 2017.
Objectives: Our aim was to evaluate the status of, and prospects for, biological control of IAPs
in South Africa. We discuss expansion of biological control and suggest indicators to be used
in the upcoming NSR to assess sufficient growth.
Method: We used published literature, unpublished work and personal communication to assess
the status of biological control of IAPs. We propose indicators based on the targets for biological
control that were proposed in the 2014 ‘National Strategy for dealing with biological invasions in
South Africa’. To prioritise targets for future efforts, we used published lists of damaging IAPs
and assessed the prospects for their biological control. Recommendations for using biological
control as a management tool were made after discussion among the authors and with colleagues.
Results: Significant control of several Cactaceae, Australian Acacia species and floating aquatic
plants, and many other IAPs has been achieved in South Africa since 1913. Recently, biological
control has benefited from improved international collaboration, a streamlined application
process for the release of new biological control agents (resulting in the approval of 19 agents
against 13 IAP species since 2013), and increased funding and capacity. There is still a need
to improve implementation and to better integrate biological control with other control
methods. In order to maximise benefits from biological control, increased investment is
required, particularly in implementation and post-release evaluation, and in targeting new
IAPs. Proposed targets for growth between 2017 and 2020 include an increase in financial
investment in research by 29%, implementation by 28% and mass-rearing by 68%. Research
capacity should increase by 29%, implementation capacity by 63% and mass-rearing capacity
by 61%. New research projects should be initiated on 12 new IAP targets, while post-release

Coleoptera: Buprestide) on municipal forestry budgets. Three distinct phases were evident: an initial
time period of 0–4 years (little budget change), year 5–8 time period (rapid budget increase), and years
9–12 (rapid budget decrease) after EAB was confirmed in a state. The 5–8 year time period had increased
spending as detected through the total forestry budget (p = 0.011), total municipal forestry budget (percent
forestry budget) as a percentage of the total municipal budget (p < 0.001), and per capita spending
(p < 0.001). A $1.58 per capita increase occurred in annual municipal forestry budgets in states in which
EAB was confirmed (EAB+) compared to states without a confirmed EAB case (EAB?). This has a $280.5
(±79.9) million annual impact on municipal budgets. The percent forestry budget increased as the time
since EAB was confirmed in a state increased. A mean 0.33% (0.03 SE, n = 82) percent forestry budget
occurred during the initial 0–4 years after confirmation of EAB. This exponentially increased from 0.47%
(0.05 SE, n = 43) in year 5 to 1.17% (0.12 SE, n = 38) at the peak in year 8, and rapidly declined back to
0.47% (0.05 SE, n = 51) in years 10–12 which was a level slightly higher than initial conditions. Federal,

commenced in 1987, was costed at $21.6 million. It was Australia’s largest outbreak and occurred at a

recent decades, due to increased transport, trade, and travel. China has become one
of the countries most seriously affected by invasive species. In response to the
severe threat of invasive alien species in China, the national strategies for managing
invasive species have been developed, which defined the roles and responsibilities
of government. In the past decades, Chinese government has initiated a series of
activities to build administrative capacity, strengthen research capacity, promote
international cooperation and raise public awareness. In addition, Chinese government
promoted the implementation of coordinated measures and cooperative efforts
throughout China and development of new prevention and control technology to
prevent or minimize adverse impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on biodiversity,
as well as their consequences for the economy and human health and well-beings.

"IC_4.0_1069","SC3047","WoS","Manfrin et al 2018","the apparently relentless spread of the major decapod alien species in the mediterranean basin and european inland waters","Manfrin C et al ","Among the many alien crustacean species so far recorded in the
Mediterranean basin are numerous decapods—crayfish, crabs and prawns—that
have in common the reputation of being both aggressive and adaptable to various
environments. Their entrance to the Mediterranean basin has often been fostered by
human actions, such as the transfer of new species for commercial purposes or
accidentally, as bycatch or because they were present in discarded ships’ ballast
water. Marine alien species enter the Mediterranean basin from two main directions:
from the Atlantic and beyond, and from the Indian Ocean via the Suez Canal. For
freshwaters, the extensive European canal network is an important aid to migration,
but human discards are also significant. Protection of native fauna and ecosystems
is at best partial. Freshwater ecosystems particularly at risk include lagoons, river
estuaries, ponds and marshes, while comparable marine systems are shallow muddy
coastal regions, rocky reefs, estuaries/bays and salt marshes. Local communities,
principally anglers and people working with aquatic resources, usually are curious
at the appearance of a new species and the possibility of establishing a new business
is often the first thought. However, freshwater decapod alien species cause major damage to agriculture production, infrastructures, riverbanks, irrigation systems and
fish production, leading to consistent economic losses. In particular, they are known
to be injurious to plant production, causing increasing losses to agriculture, consuming
young seedlings and seeds and causing substantial water losses from field
areas. Less information is available for seawater species to date, but their increasing
number and growing size of populations requires the attention of the scientific
community to evaluate and predict their influence on the marine environment and/
or on local fish and bivalve production. Both freshwater and marine alien decapods
thus represent a serious threat to native European species and have a negative
impact on species richness and habitats. The economic losses caused by these
species require reliable and cost-effective options for managing their abundance and
if possible for their eradication.",2018,"English","Book chapter",NA,"Yes","Animalia","Arthropoda","Malacostraca","Decapoda","Cambaridae","Procambarus","Procambarus clarkii",NA,"red swamp crayfish","Aquatic","Aquatic",NA,NA,"other","N","N","Europe","Italy",NA,"Italy","Country","3 years","Period",NA,NA,2016,2018,"One-time","2675000.00",NA,NA,"3083730.62","3840558.56",891666.67,1027910.21,1280186.19,"EUR",2018,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Fishery","Control/Eradication/Research","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,NA,"no","A recent EU LIFE European project (RARITY, http://www.life-rarity.eu/) on

The national stocktake of biosecurity investment uses the national portfolio investment

governments are investing in biosecurity.
Reported through the NBC, the annual stocktake captures estimates of jurisdictionsí overall
investment in biosecurity with results available for total state and territory investment and
total Australian Government investment. The stocktake has been completed for the 2013ñ14,
2014ñ15 and 2015ñ16 financial years.

as a result, are not public. The panel was provided with copies but with restrictions on
what information can be reported publicly. The panel believes that greater transparency by
jurisdictions and the NBC on biosecurity investments would facilitate the required debate in
this critical area.

claims made in submissions to this review that proportionally government appropriation
funding has been static or in decline while externally sourced funds (that is, cost recovery and

A wide variety of terms have been used to describe the management of invasive alien species and the sequence in which they might be applied. This variety and lack of consistency creates uncertainty in the presentation and description of management in policy, science and practice. Here we expand on the existing description of the invasion process to develop an IAS management framework. We define the different forms of active management using a novel approach based on changes in species status, avoiding the need for stand-alone descriptions of management types, and provide a complete set of potential management activities. We propose a standardised set of management terminology as an emergent feature of this framework. We identified eight key forms of management: (1) pathway management, (2) interception, (3) limits to keeping, (4) secure keeping, (5) eradication, (6) complete reproductive removal, (7) containment and (8) suppression. We recognise four associated terms: prevention; captive management; rapid eradication; and long-term management, and note the use of impact mitigation and restoration as associated forms of management. We discuss the wider use of this framework and the supporting activities required to ensure management is well-targeted, cost-effective and makes best use of limited resources.",2020,"English","Peer-reviewed article",NA,"Yes","Animalia","Chordata","Mammalia","Carnivora","Mustelidae","Neovison","Neovison vison",NA,"American mink","Semi-aquatic","Semi-Aquatic","aquatic","11","other",NA,"Y","Europe","Iceland",NA,"Diverse/Unspecified","Country","Between 1958 and 2019 (61 years)","Period",1958,2019,1958,2019,"Potentially ongoing","21000000.00",NA,NA,"19889061.65",NA,338709.68,320791.32,NA,"USD",2020,"Publication year","Observed","Report/Estimation","Authorities-Stakeholders","Control/Eradication","Management","Post-invasion_management","High",NA,NA,NA,"SC30_IS1/SC31_IS2/SC32_IS3 overlap","no","Cumulated subsidies for local suppression of mink by hunters were estimated to amount to more than $21 m (approx. 18.6 m EUR) since 1958 (Robertson et al. 2020); IS1: von Schmalensee 2010 -  period of estimation 1994-2009; IS2: Ministry of.. 2014 - period of estimation 2000-2012; IS3: Robertson et al 2020 - period of estimation 1958-2019.

We will use Trifolium species introduced to New Zealand and their soil-borne enemies as a model system to test this dynamic enemy release hypothesis. We will measure the impact of soil enemies on plant performance in both the introduced New Zealand and native ranges of 17 Trifolium species, use this to quantify the strength of enemy release, and test whether time since arrival, extent of distribution in New Zealand, or the presence of close relatives can explain the variation in enemy release as predicted by the dynamic enemy release hypothesis.

We will test the hypothesis that a complex interplay between a diversity of pathogens, parasites, prey and competitors determines the variation in abundance and dominance of the globally invasive wasp Vespula vulgaris. We will examine how interaction networks vary within and between the native and invaded ranges, and among groups of nests displaying low and high fitness. To analyse differences in networks we will use a state-of-the-art Molecular Ecological Network Analysis Pipeline. Variation in the entire ecological network will be related to the expenditure of immune defences in the native and invasive ranges of these wasps, enabling us to test the Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability hypothesis.

Until recently, heritable genetic variation has been almost exclusively identified with variation in genomic DNA nucleotide sequences. However, there is increasing acceptance that non-DNA nucleotide sequence-based variation – collectively termed ‘epigenetics’ - can affect ecologically important traits. Biological invasions provide an opportunity to observe evolution, within historical time scales, as introduced taxa adapt to novel biogeographic habitats in which they have not evolved. Despite such challenges many invasive species are extremely successful in new environments, often out-competing locally-adapted native species. Using a highly invasive marine invertebrate, Didemnum vexillum (phylum: Chordata), as the experimental species this study will investigate environmental induction of changes in two distinct sources of epigenetic variation, DNA cystosine methylation and A-to-I RNA editing. These modifications have been associated with population- (DNA methylation) and individual-level (RNA editing) adaptation to environmental stress. The current rapid pace of global environmental change will undoubtedly challenge the adaptive capabilities of many taxa.

At higher densities, and depending on the water depth, the flow can partially skim over structures rather than penetrate to the bed. This skimming flow can generate shear and eddies at the top of the root and seedling structures which may be especially effective at lifting sediment into the water. On a larger scale, sediment moving between these structures and the established canopy controls sediment deposition and changes to bed elevation within the swamp.

The solutions to many pressing problems such as invasive weeds, biodiversity loss and the conservation of endemic species in a changing climate, all hinge on the processes that lead species to form communities. Communities form as species disperse into new habitats and begin to interact with other species. Surprisingly, we have a poor understanding of how the dispersal or arrival of a species relates to its ability to interact with others. This gap limits predictions of how changes in biodiversity will affect ecosystem productivity. Using novel experimental approaches, cutting-edge ecological theory, and DNA sequencing technology, we will explore these relationships. We will examine networks of plants and their symbiotic fungi because these communities allow experimental manipulation not possible in other systems. This work will overcome limitations of previous studies to reveal how the characteristics that determine species' arrival to a new habitat relate to their abilities to interact with other species.

However, a complete understanding of the ecological consequences of rat invasions on islands is missing because current evidence for prehistoric rat impacts is largely speculative, and contemporary studies of rat impacts are set in long-modified ecosystems. Our remarkable new discovery of 750?300 year-old Pacific rat (kiore/Rattus exulans) coprolites (preserved faeces) in NZ provides a globally unique opportunity to reconstruct the diet and impacts of an invasive animal on an intact biota, from the time of its first introduction. An individual rat coprolite preserves exquisite molecular and microscopic evidence for everything consumed over several meals by the depositing rat. We will analyse hundreds of Pacific rat coprolites using ancient DNA and microscopic techniques. Combining this data with radiocarbon dating and quantitative modelling approaches, we will provide a uniquely detailed chronological and data-rich reconstruction of a prehistoric invasion. By revealing previously undocumented interactions between rats and a diverse range of indigenous plants and animals, we will advance current thinking about the legacy of rat invasions on ecosystem composition and function. Our study will provide a global benchmark for understanding prehistoric island invasions.

This project will study networks of interactions among plants and their pollinators and seed dispersers to understand the situations under which niche vs. neutral processes are most important. In particular, we will test whether exotic species and species that interact with many others choose their interaction partners less on the basis of their traits, and more based on their abundance. Then we will test whether the importance of niche vs. neutral processes is constant in time and space, and along environmental gradients. Finally, we will use these findings to model how changing importance of niche vs. neutral processes influences the vulnerability of interaction networks to invasions by exotic species, and the survival of native species.

Economic assessments regarding the costs of invasive species often reveal important costs from required control measures or damages. Despite the rapid invasion of the Asian yellow-legged hornet in Europe and potential damage to apiculture and pollination services, the costs of its invasion have not been evaluated yet. Here we aimed at studying the costs arising from the Asian yellow-legged hornet invasion by providing the first estimate of the control cost. Today, the invasion of the Asian yellow-legged hornet is mostly controlled by nest destruction. We estimated that nest destruction cost €23 million between 2006 and 2015 in France. The yearly cost is increasing as the species keeps spreading and could reach €11.9 million in France, €9.0 million in Italy and €8.6 million in the United Kingdom if the species fills its current climatically suitable distribution. Although more work will be needed to estimate the cost of the Asian yellow-legged hornet on apiculture and pollination services, they likely exceed the current costs of control with nest destruction.

The disease has serious agronomic and political consequences because it causes enormous economic losses. In countries in which sharka is endemic, a high percentage of apricot and European plum production is unmarketable because of the disease.
